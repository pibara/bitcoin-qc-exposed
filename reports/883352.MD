#Bitcoin QC Kanarie run from 2025-02-11T01:30:58 till 2025-02-11T22:53:02

This is a report of recent transactions comming from reused addresses.
The goal of this report is to act as a kanarie service for future quantum computing heists.
At current levels of key-reuse, these reports seem useless.
While awareness is high, it seems not high enough for this kanarie posta to be usefull yet
