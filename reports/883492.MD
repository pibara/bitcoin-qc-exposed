# Bitcoin QC Kanarie run from 2025-02-11T23:13:57 till 2025-02-13T00:45:29

This is a report of recent transactions comming from reused addresses.
The goal of this report is to act as a kanarie service for future quantum computing heists.
At current levels of key-reuse, these reports seem useless.
While awareness is high, it seems not high enough for this kanarie posta to be usefull yet

## Overview
A percentage of 23.8% of thr total volume came from previously exposed addresses.

Of these exposed addresses, the following table gives an overview. The columns show the order of magnitude of volume transfered per address
The rows show the year the given adresses first had their public keys exposed. The cells show the percentage of exposed volume per combination.
